ðŸ“Š Data Science & AI/ML Project

This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of real-world projects focused on machine learning, deep learning, and data science. These projects demonstrate practical implementations across a range of domains such as healthcare, agriculture, finance, and space science. Below is a summary of each project:

1. AI Hand Gesture Recognition
Language: Python | Tech Stack: OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras
Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning. Leveraged landmark detection from MediaPipe to recognize static gestures and map them to user-defined commands. This project highlights expertise in image processing and human-computer interaction (HCI).

2. Asteroid Detection using Machine Learning
Language: Python | Tech Stack: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Implemented a classification model to predict potentially hazardous asteroids using NASAâ€™s dataset. Preprocessed astronomical data, applied feature engineering, and trained models like Random Forest and SVM. The project aimed at understanding space object patterns and mitigating risks through data insights.

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Language: Python | Tech Stack: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, PCA
Created a binary classification system to detect fraudulent transactions from anonymized credit card datasets. Applied techniques like SMOTE for class imbalance, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and ensemble learning for accurate prediction. Focused on anomaly detection and financial security.

4. Crop Disease Identification
Language: Python | Tech Stack: CNN, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
Built a convolutional neural network model to identify plant diseases from leaf images. Trained on a labeled dataset of various crop diseases, the model helps farmers in early disease detection and management, thus supporting precision agriculture.

5. Heart Disease Risk Assessment
Language: Python | Tech Stack: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Streamlit
Analyzed medical data to build a predictive model that assesses the risk of heart disease in patients. Included an interactive dashboard for real-time risk analysis. This project demonstrates practical application of ML in healthcare for preventive diagnostics.

6. Plant Disease Detection (Jupyter Notebook)
Language: Python | Tech Stack: CNN, Matplotlib, Keras
Focused on detecting multiple plant diseases using deep learning models. Visualized data insights using plots and provided classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Complementary to the ZIP-based crop project, but presented in notebook format for experimentation.
